This project allows a user to create a Centos VM for pre-Europa Zenoss
source-build development.  The intended usage is to check out source code on
the host, perform a source build on the guest, mount the host's source on the
guest, and link to the mounted source.  Then code can be edited on the host
and changes will be reflected on the guest.

Checkout on the host:
# The Vagrantfile automatically mounts ./src as /home/vagrant/work
$ cd ./src
$ svn checkout http://dev.zenoss.com/svnint/branches/core/zenoss-4.x/ core

Build on the guest:
$ vagrant ssh
$ sudo su - zenoss
$ mkdir build; cd build
$ svn co http://dev.zenoss.com/svnint/branches/core/zenoss-4.x/inst
Then perform normal configure, build, mkzenossinstance steps

Mount the src folder:
We want to mount ./src as /home/zenoss/work with the owner set to "zenoss".
However, the user zenoss does not exist until after the provisioning has
completed.  So, I hack around it by doing the initial "vagrant up" with the
synced_folder line for ./src commented out.  After the provisioning has
completed, uncomment the synced_folder line and run "vagrant reload" to
reload the VM with the synced folder.
